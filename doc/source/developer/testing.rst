Testing
-------

Done through Python examples, driven a frame at a time. Assertions about
what state the ``Sprites`` should be in afterwards. Quite clunky but
couldn’t see any real alternative. Mocks etc provided via a dependency
bundle; described under :doc:`Skulpt API / Pytch environment <./skulpt-pytch-environment>`.
